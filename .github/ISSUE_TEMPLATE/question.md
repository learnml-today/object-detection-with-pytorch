As we have limited resources to answer an all questions, please read this rules before submit one.

### Rules:
1.    **Ask only questions related to course and not you personal projects, etc.** it doesn't mean that you can't ask them, but they will have lower priority and can be not answered at all.
2.    **Look on the Internet first.** Before submitting a question try to find answer on the Internet first, and ask question only if you didn't find the answer, or it not full, or you doesn't understand the answer.
3.    **Second, look on the closed issues.** You question can be already asked by someone else and get an answer.
4.    **No one know everything.** You should understand that ML area is very vast and we currently may have no answer for you. So it can take time to study your problem and prepare an answer.
